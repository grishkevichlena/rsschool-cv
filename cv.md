## About myself
I have been working as an English tutor and translator for 8 years. During this time I have increased my level of English, developed my communicational skills and got used to the state of constant studying and self-education. I perceive new information pretty quickly and have a great variety of hobbies (playing the guitar/piano/drums, crocheting, cross stitch, reading, postcrossing, gardening, writing poems).
Now I have a desire to move forward, change my job and discover myself in a new sphere of frontend-development.
In the nearest time Iâ€™m going to receive all possible knowledge about frontend-develoment and get as much practice and experience as possible in order to receive a position in some company.
